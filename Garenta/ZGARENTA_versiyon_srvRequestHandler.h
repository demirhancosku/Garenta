 Abstract: A singleton class responsible for sending the appropriate service requests (for retrieving and modifying service data) and parsing the responses into semantic objects, using the ZGARENTA_versiyon_srv service proxy and the SDMConnectivityHelper class. The sent requests also consider the service URL and the SAP client defined in the application settings. The class is also responsible for sending the appropriate notifications to the application delegate and view controllers, for handling the request success, failure and authentication challenge.

 For enabling Single Sign On (SSO):
 At the first application run pass the username and password to securely store the user credentials on the device.
 At later calls, pass empty credentials to exctract the stored user credentials.
